# Multi-agent Collaboration for Trending Stock Financial Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a multi-agent collaboration system designed for trending stock financial analysis. The system integrates advanced language models (LLMs), financial tools, and various agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of the trading process. The agents collaborate to identify, analyze, and execute trading strategies, leveraging real-time data and sophisticated risk management techniques.

## Project Structure

### Agents and Their Roles

1. **Stock Picker Agent**: 
   - **Goal**: Identify the most trending stock to trade based on current market conditions.
   - **Tools**: 
     - SerperDevTool: For advanced search capabilities across financial data.
     - ScrapeWebsiteTool: For extracting and analyzing market trends.
   - **Mathematical Insight**: Utilizes statistical trend analysis and real-time data scraping to identify stocks with high momentum and potential for short-term gains.

2. **Senior Quantitative Data Analyst Agent**:
   - **Goal**: Analyze market data for the selected stock, using statistical modeling and machine learning to uncover actionable insights and predict market movements.
   - **Tools**:
     - SerperDevTool: For data extraction and trend analysis.
     - ScrapeWebsiteTool: For gathering real-time market data.
   - **Mathematical Insight**: Employs advanced statistical models such as ARIMA, GARCH, and machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for predictive analytics.

3. **Lead Trading Strategy Architect Agent**:
   - **Goal**: Design, optimize, and validate advanced trading strategies based on the insights from the data analyst and user-defined parameters.
   - **Tools**:
     - SerperDevTool: For strategic backtesting.
     - ScrapeWebsiteTool: For market condition assessments.
   - **Mathematical Insight**: Uses optimization techniques like Monte Carlo simulations and portfolio optimization algorithms (e.g., Markowitz Model) to balance risk and return.

4. **Chief Trade Execution Strategist Agent**:
   - **Goal**: Devise precise trade execution strategies that optimize timing, pricing, and market impact.
   - **Tools**:
     - SerperDevTool: For execution timing.
     - ScrapeWebsiteTool: For real-time market monitoring.
   - **Mathematical Insight**: Implements game theory and auction theory principles to minimize slippage and market impact during trade execution.

5. **Chief Risk Architect Agent**:
   - **Goal**: Conduct comprehensive risk assessments and recommend mitigation strategies.
   - **Tools**:
     - SerperDevTool: For risk factor analysis.
     - ScrapeWebsiteTool: For scenario analysis.
   - **Mathematical Insight**: Applies Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) models, along with stress testing to evaluate and mitigate potential risks.

### Workflow

The agents are organized into a hierarchical crew structure, orchestrated by the `Process` class from the `CrewAI` framework. The system operates as follows:

1. **Stock Picker Task**: The Stock Picker Agent identifies the most trending stock based on real-time market analysis.
2. **Data Analysis Task**: The Data Analyst Agent processes and analyzes the market data for the selected stock, providing insights into potential market movements.
3. **Strategy Development Task**: The Trading Strategy Architect Agent develops and optimizes trading strategies based on the data analysis.
4. **Execution Planning Task**: The Trade Execution Strategist Agent formulates a precise execution plan to optimize trade outcomes.
5. **Risk Assessment Task**: The Risk Architect Agent conducts a comprehensive risk assessment, providing strategic recommendations for risk mitigation.

### Orchestration

The orchestration is managed by the `CrewAI` framework, leveraging LangChain for language model interactions. The entire process can be executed sequentially or hierarchically, depending on the complexity and interdependencies of the tasks.

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-stock-analysis.git
   cd multi-agent-stock-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set up your `.env` file with the necessary API keys for OpenAI and Serper. An example `.env` file is provided.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
     ```

4. **Run the Financial Trading Process**:
   - Initialize the process with your inputs, such as initial capital, risk tolerance, and trading strategy preference.
   - Example:
     ```python
     initial_inputs = {
         'initial_capital': '100000',
         'risk_tolerance': 'Medium',
         'trading_strategy_preference': 'Day Trading',
         'news_impact_consideration': True
     }
     results = run_financial_trading_process(initial_inputs)
     print(results)
     ```

### Mathematical Considerations

This system integrates advanced mathematical and statistical models at various stages:

- **Trend Analysis**: Uses linear regression, moving averages, and relative strength index (RSI) for identifying trending stocks.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applies time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) and machine learning classifiers for market movement prediction.
- **Optimization**: Implements algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing for optimizing trading strategies.
- **Risk Management**: Utilizes Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Monte Carlo simulations for comprehensive risk assessment and management.
